# **About Me**
<br/>
Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,
<br/>

I am a passionate programmer who transitioned into software engineering from nursing field. I have worked at health care field for 5 years as a nursing assistant, and went to Stony Brook School of Nursing to pursue Bachelor of Science with Nursing major. 

I came across some project ideas that I wanted to work on, so I started studying coding by myself. When I thought that programming is for me, I decided to join Flatiron bootcamp, where I learned Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React.js with Redux, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

As a former healthcare worker, I have strong communication skills, teamwork, and working at a fast-paced, pressured environment. I can learn with fast pace, and am eager to learn.

Since I was first enrolled into Stony Brook University as a Biomedical Engineering major, I have taken majority of Mathmatics, Statistics, and Physics classes for the major. My strong problem solving skills comes from those classes, as well as my Python skill.
