# **About Me**
<br>
Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
My expected graduation date from Flatiron is October 23rd, 2020. I have worked at health care field for 5 years as a nursing assistant, and was in Stony Brook School of Nursing, pursuing for Bachelor of Science with Nursing major.

Although I only had one year left until graduation, my first 4-weeks of coding experience captivated me and made me decide to quit nursing school and dive in deeper into the developer field. 

The reason that I started studying for coding in the first place was becasue a project idea came into my mind while working at hospital. I really liked the idea, so I started to study coding during my nursing class. I am still in progress with the project, but I am hoping to present it for my capstone project.

Other than nursing background, I was in biomedical engineering major until 3rd year in college, so I took a lot of mathematics, physics related studies. These classes gave me build up my problem solving skills, which helped me power through Flatiron school. 

I would like to share my diverse knowledge with other developers, as well as learn from the others. In next 5 years, I envision myself working as a full-stack engineer, working collaboratively with others of common goals to pursue for the best for the company.
