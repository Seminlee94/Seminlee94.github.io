# WAL-E

I was inspired to do this project while delivering groceries with Instacart. I've noticed that a lot of college students didn't use the app because the tip & delivery fee can be a burden to them.

This project is an extension of Mod 1 & Mod 3 projects of grocery E-commerce. Mod 1 Cart-in project is a Ruby used cli application, where user can shop and store items into his/her fridge and look up recipes using the fridge items. Mod 3 project used vanilla javascript to create a grocery e-commerce webpage. This project uses Rails on the backend and React front end to combine those two projects together.

## Included Features
- User can sign up/ log in using localStorage.
- User can add item to the cart, where user have an option to add the item to the fridge.
- User can add item to the fridge manually in the fridge page.
- User can click on his/her favorite recipe, where it will tell the missing ingredients according to the items the user has in the fridge.
- User can add friend to the friend list and the list also shows followed by list.
- Every user has his/her own item, fridge, and friend.

## Stretch goals
- Add up to two friends to the cart, so 3 users pay equal amounts of tip, delivery fee, etc.
- Use websocket to make the adding/deleting items be live between users
- Implement Google Map API so that friends who are within amount of distance can be added to the cart.
