# DineRx ðŸ’ŠðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š

## Aboutâœ…
- I was inspired to do this project while working as a Nursing Assistant at trauma 1 hospital. I've seen many frustration in patients' eyes when they had to wait 10~15 minutes each time they call cafeteria to order their meal. With DineRx, patients now can order food online, and educate themselves about their diet as they order. 

- Patients' diets can change several times throughout their stay in the hospital. If they have a surgery scheduled, they would be placed in NPO, which means no food is allowed until further notice. A lot of patients don't know what NPO is, as well as what other diets, such as Cariac diet or Low-Sodium diet. With DineRx, patients can learn about their diet in their free time and see more importance of eating healthy. 

## Included Featuresâœ…
- User can log in using Google Map API/Auto Completion to search for their hospital.
- User can add item to the cart, view more details of the item, which includes ingredients and nutritions of the item.
- User can add items to either "order now", or "order ahead," where they can choose the date and time for the food to be delivered. 
- User can view the ordered items
- User can view the education page about their diet.
